Gifts at or below these limits generally do not need to be reported to the IRS.

            "title": "December Producer Price Increase Exceeds Forecasts",
            "descr": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand increased 0.5% in December, above market expectations of a 0.3% rise. This marked the third consecutive monthly increase and reflected higher costs in services, particularly in transportation, warehousing, and hospitality sectors. The report indicates that upstream price pressures remain a concern for businesses and policymakers, potentially influencing consumer prices in the months ahead.

            "descr": "Core services PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.6% in December, highlighting that businesses are facing rising labor and operational costs. Sectors such as trucking, freight, and logistics contributed significantly to the increase, as companies adjust pricing to cover higher wages and supply chain expenses. Economists warn that sustained services inflation could eventually feed into consumer prices, complicating the Federal Reserve’s efforts to maintain price stability.

Services have become the dominant contributor to price gains, even as goods prices, particularly in energy and commodities, show signs of easing. Analysts view this as evidence that inflation is transitioning from goods to services, which is typically more persistent and harder to tame.

While consumer inflation has shown signs of slowing, persistent services inflation at the producer level could lead the Fed to maintain higher rates for longer or delay potential cuts, signaling a more cautious approach to monetary policy.
