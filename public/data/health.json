    "shortdescription": "Despite widespread online chatter and wellness trends promoting cortisol management, doctors and endocrinologists say that most people do not need to focus on controlling their cortisol levels. Cortisol is a critical hormone for survival and naturally fluctuates throughout the day, and true cortisol disorders are uncommon and require professional medical evaluation and treatment. Instead of chasing hormone fixes, clinicians recommend basic stress‑management strategies backed by evidence.",

            "descr": "Cortisol, often labeled the “stress hormone,” is produced by the adrenal glands above the kidneys and plays a key role in regulating inflammation, metabolism, immune response, blood pressure and many other essential bodily functions. The hormone naturally rises in the morning upon waking and falls at night before sleep, and it also increases in response to genuine stressors such as illness or physical exertion. Doctors emphasize that this dynamic rhythm is normal and necessary for survival and that most concerns about cortisol stem from social media trends rather than clinical science. Disorders solely related to abnormal cortisol levels — such as adrenal insufficiency or Cushing’s syndrome — are medically rare and often caused by underlying conditions that require professional diagnosis and care. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"

For instance, common medications such as birth control can skew cortisol measurements, potentially leading to misleading results and unnecessary medical follow‑ups. Specialists like Dr. Katie Guttenberg of UTHealth Houston stress that diagnosing hormonal disorders typically requires multiple tests and careful clinical evaluation to distinguish normal cortisol fluctuations from true pathology. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

These products are not regulated for safety or efficacy, and some may have unintended effects. Experts such as Dr. James Findling of the Medical College of Wisconsin warn that these supplements can be misleading at best and potentially harmful at worst. Even in cases of clinically high cortisol, prescription medications and treatment decisions must be tailored carefully to each patient’s needs, as overtreatment can lead to dangerously low cortisol levels and other health complications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}"

This translates to a recommendation that many adults aim for at least about 100 grams of protein per day, with at least half coming from animal sources, according to the updated guidance.

Officials behind the guidelines say this broader approach is intended to improve overall diet quality.
