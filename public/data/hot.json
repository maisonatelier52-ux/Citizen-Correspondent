    "shortdescription": "Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, after overseeing the deadliest crackdown on nationwide protests, has shifted his stance by engaging in nuclear negotiations with the United States and warning that a U.S. military strike would spark a regional war, in an effort to avert direct conflict.",

            "descr": "In the face of widespread demonstrations that erupted across Iran in late December over economic hardships and clerical rule, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei authorized a severe crackdown through Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and security forces — the most lethal in his nearly four decades of rule. Activists say thousands have been killed and tens of thousands detained in the effort to suppress dissent and restore state control. The unprecedented scope of the protests, with chants targeting Khamenei personally, reflected deep socioeconomic frustrations and ideological challenges to the ruling theocracy. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

An American naval flotilla deployed in the region and the Trump administration repeatedly warned of potential military action if Iranian authorities continued to endanger civilians or escalate provocative behavior. In response, Khamenei issued stern warnings that any U.S. attack would not only be met with force but could trigger a wider regional conflict, illustrating the depth of mistrust and strategic brinkmanship between the two powers. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}"

This marks a reversal from his earlier hard‑line rejection of talks, suggesting a calculation that diplomacy may buy time and avert direct conflict. Negotiations are being facilitated by regional actors and are set to resume in Muscat, Oman, with both sides under intense international scrutiny. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}"

Once a bastion of a large middle class, the Iranian economy now struggles with a precipitous currency collapse and rising living costs, factors that helped catalyze the mass protests.

While both sides seek to avoid full‑scale war, the volatile mix of hardened political positions, unresolved economic discontent, and geopolitical rivalry leaves the outlook uncertain. Regional powers and international mediators continue to press for diplomatic solutions, but the possibility of renewed conflict remains a significant risk. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}"
