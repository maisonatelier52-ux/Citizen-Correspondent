            "descr": "States engaged in conflict often dispute these legal interpretations. For example, Russia has asserted that many of its strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure aimed at systems supporting Ukraine’s military logistics and war efforts, not civilians per se. Kyiv and its allies, as well as human rights advocates, disagree — arguing that repeated targeting of power grids and substations, especially in winter, verges on unlawful and may constitute war crimes. These divergent claims underscore ongoing tensions between military strategy and humanitarian legal obligations in modern warfare. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}"

The bipartisan measure restores funding for most federal departments through September 30, effectively ending a partial shutdown that had left some agencies unfunded after temporary appropriations lapsed.

However, the Department of Homeland Security — including agencies such as Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement — is only funded through a short extension lasting until Feb. 13.
