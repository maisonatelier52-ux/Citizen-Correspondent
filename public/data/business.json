    "shortdescription": "A growing number of U.S. renters are turning to \"rent now, pay later\" services like Flex, Livble and Affirm to spread out monthly rent payments, but mounting fees and high effective interest rates have raised alarms among consumer advocates who warn the products may worsen financial strain for already cost‑burdened households.",

            "title": "How ‘Rent Now, Pay Later’ Works",
            "descr": "So‑called “rent now, pay later” services allow renters to split their monthly rent into two or more payments rather than paying a large lump sum at the start of the month. Under this arrangement, a third‑party company pays the full rent to the landlord on time, and the renter repays the company over weeks. Advocates of these services say they can ease cash‑flow challenges for renters with variable incomes or unpredictable pay schedules, particularly gig‑economy workers and those with limited savings. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

            "title": "Fees and Costs Can Be Significant",
            "descr": "Although touted as a flexible payment tool, the services often include fees that consumer advocates say make them akin to short‑term loans. For example, one renter paid more than $33 a month in subscription and service fees for a two‑week split on a $1,850 rent payment — translating to an effective annual percentage rate of 172% when calculated using standard lending formulas. Critics warn that these costs, layered on top of already stretched budgets, can deepen financial stress instead of alleviating it. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}"

Flex charges a monthly subscription plus a percentage of the rent, while Livble typically charges a flat fee that can amount to a high effective annual rate. Buy‑now‑pay‑later firm Affirm is piloting a rent‑splitting option without direct renter fees, but access depends on subscribing to additional services that carry their own monthly costs. These discrepancies make it harder for consumers to compare true costs across platforms. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}"

For a $1,500 rent, that could add roughly $37.50 to $52.50 in costs, roughly comparable to fees from dedicated rent‑splitting services. These alternatives highlight how many payment options feature hidden charges that may strain household finances. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}"

The S&P 500 remained nearly flat, barely changing from its previous close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped, and the Nasdaq Composite managed a slight gain. The overall trend reflected cautious trading and investor indecision after several days of uneven market moves, with participants balancing concerns about economic risks, earnings outlooks and broader geopolitical factors. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"

            "descr": "A key contributor to the subdued market performance was a sharp decline in Intel’s stock, which tumbled approximately 17% in a single session. Despite the semiconductor company reporting fourth‑quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, its guidance for the first quarter fell well short of forecasts, prompting a significant sell‑off. Investors focused on concerns over production constraints and weaker future demand, dragging down sentiment across the technology sector and weighing on broader indexes. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}"

The strong rally in gold underscored continued investor demand for safe‑haven assets amid lingering uncertainty in global markets.

Financial stocks such as Capital One Financial declined sharply following weaker profit results, while industrial names like CSX demonstrated resilience by posting gains despite disappointing earnings.
