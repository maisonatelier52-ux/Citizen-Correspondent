Federal deficits have become a structural feature of the U.S. budget, fueled by rising entitlement costs, growing interest payments on debt and repeated tax cuts enacted without offsetting revenue measures. Over time, this steady imbalance risks weakening investor confidence and limiting the government’s ability to respond to future crises."
